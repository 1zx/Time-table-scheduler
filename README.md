# **AUTOMATED TIME-TABLE SCHEDULER** *(USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS)*

Time Table Scheduling is an NP-hard problem and hence polynomial time verifiable using genetic algorithms. It a typical scheduling problem that appears to be a tedious job in every academic institute once or twice a year. In earlier days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group involved in task of scheduling it manually, which takes a lot of effort and time. Planning timetables is one of the most complex and error-prone applications.
Timetabling is the task of creating a timetable while satisfying some constraints. There are basically two types of constraints, soft constraints and hard constraints. Soft constraints are those if we violate them in scheduling, the output is still valid, but hard constraints are those which if we violate them; the timetable is no longer valid. The search space of a timetabling problem is too vast, many solutions exist in the search space and few of them are not feasible. Feasible solutions here mean those which do not violate hard constraints and as well try to satisfy soft constraints. We need to choose the most appropriate one from feasible solutions. Most appropriate ones here mean those which do not violate soft constraints to a greater extent. In this project hard-constraints have been taken care of strictly and it has been ensured that soft-constraints are as well followed as much as possible.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
